      <description>Hello! We are a group of facutly, postdocs, and research specialists who are enthusiastic about using R programming language for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and presentation. Each week, we meet to share one new tool that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned. Our R club website (made with the R package &amp;lsquo;blogdown&amp;rsquo;!) will chronicle the new tools we learn as a series of blog posts.
Over the course of our blog posts, we will introduce ourselves and share a bit about our research interests.</description>
