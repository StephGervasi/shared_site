Hello! We are a group of facutly, postdocs, and research specialists who are enthusiastic about using R programming language for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and presentation. Each week, we meet to share one new tool that we've learned. Our R club website (made with the R package 'blogdown'!) will chronicle the new tools we learn as a series of blog posts.

Over the course of our blog posts, we will introduce ourselves and share a bit about our research interests.

We work at the [**Monell Chemical Senses Center**](http://monell.org), in beautiful Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
Monell is the worldâ€™s only independent, non-profit scientific institute dedicated to basic research on taste and smell. Collectively, we work on understanding the mechanisms and functions of taste and smell.
