This week we talked Rprojects and version control with Nicolle M. It was enlightening! 

We all strive for reproducible research and many of us collaborate with scientists outside of the Institute. Standardizing our workflow with the use of Rprojects and making sure that R and Git (and therefore GitHub) can communicate, bidirectionally, will take our own research and our collaborative work to the next level.

Below is an excellent short YouTube clip put together by Sam Burer about how to use Rprojects...

...and a link to Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's "R for Data Science" chapter on Project Workflow (did you know you can get this WHOLE BOOK online, for free?!):

Additionally, these two resources through Software Carpentry are especially useful intros to Rprojects and using Git:

Last but definitley not least, Nicolle presented us with this extremely helpful resource by Jenny Bryan, called "Happy Git and GitHub for the useR". This was a game changer for us!!!
